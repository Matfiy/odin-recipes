    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There’s nothing quite like the comforting aroma of a freshly baked old-fashioned apple pie wafting through the kitchen. This timeless recipe begins with a flaky, buttery crust made from scratch — simple ingredients like flour, cold butter, and a touch of salt come together to create the perfect golden base. The filling features crisp, tart apples (like Granny Smith or Honeycrisp) sliced thin and tossed with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of lemon juice for brightness. As the pie bakes, the apples soften into a sweet, spiced filling that perfectly balances the tender, buttery crust.</p>
    <p>Once out of the oven, the pie is best served warm, allowing the fragrant spices and apple filling to shine. A scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream adds the perfect finishing touch. This old-fashioned apple pie isn’t just a dessert — it’s a cozy reminder of home, tradition, and the simple joy of baking something from the heart.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package pastry for a double-crust 9-inch pie</li>
        <li>7 cups peeled, cored and sliced apples</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with bottom crust.</li>
        <li>Combine apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl. Place mixture into the prepared pie plate. Dot with butter. Cover with top crust and seal. Cut holes in top crust to allow venting.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and bake until crust is golden brown and apples are tender, 40 for 50 minutes. Cool and serve.</li>
    </ol>
