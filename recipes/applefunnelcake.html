    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Apple Funnel Cake brings a delicious twist to a fairground favorite with the cozy flavors of homemade apple dessert. The batter starts light and airy — a mix of flour, eggs, milk, and a touch of sugar — then folded together with finely diced apples and a dash of cinnamon for warmth. Once poured into hot oil in a swirling pattern, the funnel cake fries to a perfect golden brown, crisp on the edges and soft in the middle, with bits of tender apple in every bite.</p>
    <p>After frying, the cake is dusted generously with powdered sugar and a sprinkle of extra cinnamon. For an extra treat, drizzle it with caramel sauce or serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This Apple Funnel Cake captures the sweet, comforting taste of autumn — a perfect dessert for fall festivals, family gatherings, or anytime you want a cozy homemade indulgence.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h4>Batter</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple pie spice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup applesauce</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Apple Topper</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 pounds apples, peeled and chopped (about 4 cups)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons apple pie spice</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Fry and Serve</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil, or as needed, for frying</li>
        <li>caramel-flavor ice cream topping, and/or powdered sugar, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, apple pie spice, and salt in a bowl for the batter.</li>
        <li>Whisk together milk, applesauce, eggs, white sugar, and almond extract in a large bowl until combined. Add flour mixture and whisk until smooth. Batter should have the consistency of a cake batter and be thin enough to pass through a funnel.</li>
        <li>For apple topper, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add apples, brown sugar, and apple pie spice; cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour oil to a depth 1 1/2 to 2 inches in a deep, heavy- bottomed 8- to 10-inch skillet or deep fryer; heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Put your finger over bottom opening of a funnel; fill funnel with 1/2 cup batter. Holding funnel close to surface of oil, release batter into oil while making a circular motion. Fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Use tongs and a wide spatula to carefully turn funnel cake. If you don’t have a funnel, you can use a squeeze bottle instead. Fry until golden, about 1 minute more. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining batter. Keep finished funnel cakes warm in a 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) oven while preparing remaining funnel cakes.</li>
        <li>Top with apple topper. Serve with caramel topping and/or powdered sugar.</li>
