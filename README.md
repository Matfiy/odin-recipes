# odin-recipes

A simple recipe website made with HTML that
includes a few links to recipes on the main index page.

For the cowboy cookie bars recipe, allrecipes actually had images, so I added them into the web page along with the steps.

Good challenge but a lot of learning left to do :)

10/16/25 - added external css pages for each webpage - adopted the previous html code in order to make css styling easier - added css code in order to style and make the webpages look a little better (could be way better) - happy with the progress so far, learning much more than my college web programming class right now XD
